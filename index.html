				<h1>Over 200 Years of History</h1>
				
				<p>Built in 1806, this house has stood through a great portion of American history. Originally constructed as a bed and breakfast, it is now going back to its roots of housing adventurous
				travelers and those who wish to experience a little bit of the past.</p>
				
				<p>Nestled just outside of the small town of Cochranton, PA, get a feel of the country and experience a little bit of Pennsylvania's scenic beauty.</p>

				<h1>Not Too Far From the Places That Matter</h1>
				
				<p>While being out in nature is soothing, if you still need more civilization, you don't have to spend hours driving to find it.</p>
				
				<p>Want to do some shopping? If some quick pickups or groceries is what you're after, Meadville, PA is minutes away. Looking for some higher end products? The Grove City Outlets are less than an hour south. And if all else fails, Erie, PA is about a hour's drive north.</p>
			
				<p>Looking to find a place to stay when visiting a college student? We're less than 20 minutes from Allegheny College and LTI, and less than 40 minutes from Thiel or Penn State Extension.</p>

				<h1>Old Time Feeling, Today's Luxuries</h1>
				
				<p>Despite the age of the house, you don't have to live like you're in the 19th century.</p>
				
				<p>The entire guest unit has its own heating system, electricity, hot water, and a guest-accessible WiFi network. Bedrooms 7 and 5 have their own TVs, with HDMI ports so you can hook up your phone or computer.</p>
				
				<p>The common living/dining area features a full kitchenette, complete with refrigerator, stove, oven, microwave, coffee maker, and cooking utensils.</p>
				
				<p>We care about the safety of our guests. The private guest entry features individually programmed keycodes for each guest. Each room also has its own room key and lock, protecting your privacy and belongings.</p>
